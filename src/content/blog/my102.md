# Understanding Asynchronous Programming

In Node.js, many operations are I/O bound and may take some time to complete, such as reading files, making network requests, or querying databases. Instead of waiting for these operations to finish, Node.js executes them asynchronously, allowing it to continue executing other tasks in the meantime.

Traditional approaches to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js include callbacks and Promises. While effective, they can lead to callback hell or complex Promise chains. Async/Await, introduced in ES2017 (ES8), provides a cleaner and more readable way to work with asynchronous code, making it easier to write and maintain.

## Introducing Async/Await
Async/Await is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, allowing you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner. It consists of two keywords:

async: This keyword is used to define a function that returns a Promise. It allows you to use the await keyword within the function.
await: This keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved. It can only be used inside an async function.
Async/Await simplifies asynchronous code by making it look more like synchronous code, which is easier to read and understand.

## Example: Reading a File Asynchronously
Let’s start with a simple example of reading a file asynchronously using Node.js built-in fs module. We’ll create a function to read a file and log its contents.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

async function readFileAsync(filePath) {
  try {
    const data = await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', error);
  }
}

readFileAsync('example.txt');
```
In this example:

We define an async function readFileAsync that takes a file path as an argument.
Inside the function, we use await to pause the execution until fs.promises.readFile returns a result.
If the file is read successfully, we log its contents. Otherwise, we handle any errors that occur during the operation.

## Example: Making HTTP Requests Asynchronously
Another common asynchronous task in Node.js is making HTTP requests. Let’s create a function to fetch data from an API using the axios library.

```js
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchDataAsync(url) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    console.log('Data:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

fetchDataAsync('https://api.example.com/data');
```
In this example:

We define an async function fetchDataAsync that takes a URL as an argument.
Inside the function, we use await to pause the execution until axios.get returns a result.
If the request is successful, we log the fetched data. Otherwise, we handle any errors that occur during the operation.

## Conclusion
Async/Await is a powerful feature in Node.js that simplifies asynchronous programming, making it easier to write and maintain asynchronous code. By combining async functions with await, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, without sacrificing performance or readability.

Since Node v11.0.0 fs promises are available natively without promisify:
```js
const fs = require('fs').promises;
async function loadMonoCounter() {
    const data = await fs.readFile("monolitic.txt", "binary");
    return Buffer.from(data);
}
```

import { promises as fs } from "fs"; if you want to use import syntax. –

A note on this approach, while it is clean, it also doesn't import other useful features of fs outside of the fs.promises api. It may be important to import fs separately from fs.promises. –

I'm getting a weird response with this: Buffer(18524) [60, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 32, 116, 110, 116, 45, 108, 105, 98, 62, 13, 10, 32, 32, 32, 32, 47, 42, 42, 13, 10, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 42, 32, 67, 111, 112, 121, 114,, …] what could it be? –

Once you have the Buffer, you can convert it to a string using Buffer's method toString() like bufferData.toString() - see the docs for Buffer. –

Hint: call await fs.readFile("monolitic.txt", "utf8"); to get the file content as a string –

I like const fs = require('fs/promises'); a bit more :) –

Use return Buffer.from(data) or another alternative to avoid (node:76590) [DEP0005] warning. –

so complicated, took me 1hr to see that you need to import require('fs').promises –

You can easily wrap the readFile command with a promise like so:

```js
async function readFile(path) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', function (err, data) {
        if (err) {
          reject(err);
        }
        resolve(data);
      });
    });
  }
  ```
then use:
```js
await readFile("path/to/file");
```

To keep it succint and retain all functionality of fs:
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const fsPromises = fs.promises;

async function loadMonoCounter() {
    const data = await fsPromises.readFile('monolitic.txt');
    return Buffer.from(data);
}
```
Importing fs and fs.promises separately will give access to the entire fs API while also keeping it more readable... So that something like the next example is easily accomplished.
```js
// the 'next example'
fsPromises.access('monolitic.txt', fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK)
    .then(() => console.log('can access'))
    .catch(() => console.error('cannot access'));
```

I read file by using the Promise. For me its properly:
```js
const fs = require('fs')

//function which return Promise
const read = (path, type) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  fs.readFile(path, type, (err, file) => {
    if (err) reject(err)
    resolve(file)
  })
})

//example how call this function
read('file.txt', 'utf8')
    .then((file) => console.log('your file is '+file))
    .catch((err) => console.log('error reading file '+err))

//another example how call function inside async
async function func() {
  let file = await read('file.txt', 'utf8')
  console.log('your file is '+file)
}
```

You can find my approach below: First, I required fs as fsBase, then I put the "promises" inside fs variable.
```js
const fsBase = require('fs');
const fs = fsBase.promises

const fn = async () => {
    const data = await fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
};

fn();
```

Use Promise
```js
const someFunction = async () => {
    try {
        var file = () => {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                fs.readFile(__dirname + "/file.json", "utf-8", (err, data) => {
                    if (err) reject(err)
                    else resolve(data)
                })
            })
            
        }
        console.log(await file()); // this is the key
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
}
```
You need to add a try-catch block to catch the reject promise or any error that thrown. So it is better.

Or the older function style
```js
async function someFunction() {
    // the contents are the same
    // ...
}
```
The problem is, the file() runs asynchronously and the code is not waiting for the result. Put await on the fs.readFile() function doesn't mean await the file() variable to finish its execution.
