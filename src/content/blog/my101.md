# Building Web Applications using Node.js, Express and Mongo DB Part 1.
The purpose of this lab is to discover Node.js, Express, and Mongo DB and how they can be used together to build a fully functional web app. You will also be introduced to Web API’s.
## Skills Needed:

1. Intermediate JavaScript Knowledge – Most JS code will build on knowledge learned in QTR 2, but new concepts and new ways of doing old things will be shown.
1. Basic knowledge of git/cmd line commands
## Node.js Explained

Node.js is a web server that is cross-platform and open source. Cross-Platform means you can run it on a Windows PC, Mac PC, Linux PC, or any of their server versions. Open Source means the code can be viewed and modified by the community at large. This makes Node.js a powerful tool that is ever expanding and improving, with no need to purchase new updates or fixes.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs on Google’s V8 JS engine. This allows you to use JS code for the back end (server) and the front end (client). Using one language across all areas of the server has many advantages to the old web server stack LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python/PHP) which requires you to learn, know, and keep up to date several programs and languages.

Using Node.js you can serve static HTML files, dynamic web pages, and handle Web API calls. If you don’t know about Web API calls don’t worry we will learn more about it in a future lab but if you want to read about them go to: MDN Web API Calls. ()[]


## Express Framework Explained

Although you can build web servers/applications using only Node.js it is often easier and faster to use frameworks other people/organizations have created. Many such frameworks exist for running a server but one of the most common, and the one we use for the class server, is called Express. Express is a framework that allows you to create websites and Web API calls with less code, and easy to use features that you would otherwise have to hard code yourself.

Express is a thin wrapper around the Node.js http module that adds new features called middleware, routing and templating. Middleware is snippets of code you write that allows you to process incoming requests and outgoing responses. This allows you to look at each request and modify the response that’s sent back to the client. 

Routing is how a web application responds to client request and calls the appropriate code to perform a task. For example if you visit http://localhost:22022/ this call is routed by the classroom Express server to a specified JS function that returns the index page of the class website, it can just as easily return a string, or an array of items, or a JSON object.

Express also supports the ability to build dynamic webpages using templating engines. Some common templates are EJS and Pug, and there are many others. Templating helps you build dynamic webpages by marrying the data of the site with the HTML to create a final HTML page that the browser displays.

## START THE VERDACIO SERVER IF IT IS NOT RUNNING

### Excercise1: Set up Node.js project, install express server. (Roughly 10 minutes)
1. Create a Node.JS project using VS Code, Install the express and nodemon modules.
1. Navigate to the lab Folder in the QTR 3 folder, create a new folder named Lab 1. Then right click and “Open in Code”
1. Open a terminal in VS Code (CTRL + SHIFT + ` [this is the back tick not an apostrophe] or click Terminal on the top menu then New Terminal)
1. Type “npm init” in the terminal window.  NPM stands for Node Package Manager and allows you to manage the project by running commands, installing modules, and setting up special scripts. Npm init initializes the project with basic information.
1. This will bring up a series of prompts. Fill in the information with that shown below. Use your name for the Author. Hit Enter to progress through questions.
 
<img src="/image/Q3-Lab1-pic1a.png" alt="npm init package.json file">

1. This will create a package.json file in the Lab 1 folder. This file contains meta-data about the project to help the NPM run scripts for this project, install dependencies, and identify the initial JS file to use to start the application.
1. Install Express – Type “npm install express” into the terminal. This will query the verdaccio server and install the most recent version of express, using node modules, into the project.
1. Install Nodemon – type “npm install nodemon” into the terminal. Throughout this lab we will be making changes to the server. Nodemon is a middleware utility that will detect these changes and automatically restart the server when we need it to. It also has some built in debugging features that will notify us of issues if they arise.
 
<img src="/image/Q3-Lab1-pic1b.png" alt="folder project after npm install">

 Note – For purposes of this lab we will install each module separately so that if errors happen we know where they are, but you can in the future type “npm install express nodemon [any other module name]” to install all modules at once.

At this point the project folder should have the following things:
1. A node-modules folder
1. A package-lock.json file
1. A package.json file

The last thing we need to do to set up the project is to give it a start command.
1. Open the package.json file and find where it says “scripts”
1. Add “start”: “nodemon index.js”, to the scripts object above the “test” command
 
<img src="/image/Q3-Lab1-pic1c.png" alt="script-start-nodemon-index">

The content of the package.json file should be as follows:
This tells npm that when we run the “npm start” command that nodemon is to run the index.js file.

```js
{
  "name": "lab-1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js & Express Application",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "John Michael Brooks",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.22"
  }
}
```

Version numbers might be different from yours. It should not matter at this point.
1. Create an Express Server and Get Data
1. Using VS Code create a file named index.js in the Lab 1 folder and open it.
1. Add the following code to the project, you don’t have to add the comments in, they are there for your information.The content of the file should be:

```js
//Load the express Module
//Require is a built in Node.js Function that imports or adds the specified module
const express = require('express')
//import our repository obj
const repo = require('./repository/product-file')

//Create an instance of the express module
const app = express()

//Specify the port we want to use for our server
const port = 3000

//Our first GET Route
//GET is an internet REQUEST that does what its name implies it "gets" the URL 
//requested and responds with a response
//in this case '/' refers to the root url (http://localhost:3000/)
//each get request requires two things, a root, and a callback function.
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.sedn("Hello World!")
})

//Create a web Server to liston on the specified port
let server = app.listen(port, function () {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

You will notice 3 things in this code block that may be new or unfamiliar to you
1. First:
    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res, next) => ) ...
    ```
1. This is an Arrow Function it is the same thing as saying function (), but in a more elegant or  simpler way
1. get - The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
1. ${variable}: This is a String literal it is an easier way of adding variables into strings for output purposes. Console.log(‘Server is running on ⦁	http://locahost:’ + port) is functionally the same thing. 

NOTE the ` are back ticks not ‘ (apostrophe) or “ (quotes). The back tick is the shift+~ key next to the 1 on the keyboard.

In the terminal (ctrl + ‘ to bring it back up or view -> terminal if you closed it), type “npm start” you should see the same output as here:

<img src="/image/Q3-Lab1-pic1e.png" alt="terminal_view_after_npm_start">


Navigate to, or click [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the new page running 

### Return Arrays, Objects, Dynamic Data

Most websites don’t return strings, especially hard coded strings like “hello World”.  So lets add an Array Object to the response. 

Replace this line of code:
```js
    res.send("Hello World!")
```
with the following lines of code (I will let you copy and paste this as it is just “data”):
```js
    let products = [{
        "productID": 706,
        "name": "HL Road Frame - Red, 58",
        "productNumber": "FR-R92R-58",
        "color": "Red",
        "StandardCost": 1059.0000,
        "listPrice": 1500.0000
    },
    {
        "productID": 707,
        "name": "Sport-100 Helmet, Red",
        "productNumber": "HL-U509-R",
        "color": "Red",
        "StandardCost": 13.0000,
        "listPrice": 34.9900
    }]
    res.send(products)
```
1. Save the file, and you should see nodemon in the terminal state that it is restarting due to changes, and then the “server is running”  line. Check the webpage. What do you see now?
1. Rather then just using the res.send() request, we should actually send a JSON object, as browsers know how to handle them, and we can include extra information.
1. Instead of :
```js
    res.send(products)
```
replace with 
```js
    res.json({
            //200: The request succeeded
            "status": 200,
            //This can be anything, but short and informative is best
            "statusText": "OK",
            //This is informative of what happened
            "message": "All Product Retrieved",
            //data is the data sent to the client/browser
            "data": data
        })
```
Note status code numbers are a unified HTML rule. Read more [here]()

Save the index.js, and refresh the page. What do you see now? How did it change from the previous code?

### Create and use your own module to get data, basic Web API calls, etc

1. As you can see the index.js file is getting longer, and we have a mix of concerns inside of it. Mainly the get route is processing data, and returning it. Instead let’s create our own module to process the data.
1. In the Lab 1 folder create a new folder called repository, inside this folder create a new file called product-file.js.
1. In the product-file.js add the following code (Tip: Copy and paste the product array from the index.js file to save time):
1. <img src="/image/Q3-Lab1-pic1f.png" alt="product_file_dot_js__file">
1. Line 5 may look weird or unfamiliar to you don’t worry. This is how you add a function call to an object already created. It is equivalent to function () { [code here] } but allows us to access it as repo.get() when we import it into the index.js.
 Now that we have the product module created we need to import it into the index.js file. We need to add a new require for the repo under the require for express. 
1. <img src="/image/Q3-Lab1-pic1g.png" alt="require_product_file_dot_js__file">
1. We then need to update the app.get function to load the repo object.
1. Save the index.js file, reload the web page and you should see the json obj as the response.

Instead of hardcoding data into the product-file we should have an outside source, either a file, or Database, to get the product data from. In this next step we are going to use a built in Node.js library (module) called File System.

In the canvas file cache folder find a file named file-system.txt and move it into the repository folder for lab 1. Then rename to file to product.json, if you get a prompt warning you of changing extensions click yes.

Change the product-file.js file to read in the product.json file with the following code:

```js  
line 1    //Load the Node.js File System Module
line     const fs = require('fs')
line     
line     //Path/file name to the product data
line     const DATA_FILE = './repository/product.json'
line     
line     //Create a Product Repo Obj, while at same time exporting it, similiar to last example
line 8   let repo = exports = module.exports = {}
line     
line     //Create a retrieval (get) function for the products, on our repo obj
line 11  repo.get = (resolve, reject) => {
line         //Read the data from the file
line         fs.readFile(DATA_FILE, (err, data) => {
line             if (err) {
line                 //When reading in a file we always want to check for  errors first see we are not passing on bad data
line                 reject(err)
line             }
line             else {
line                 //Success: Convert Data to json and pass on
line                 let products = JSON.parse(data)
line                 resolve(products)
line             }
line         })
line     }
```  
  
  
You will notice line 8 changed, this is a doing two lines at once, combining the previous line 25, with line 8 to streamline the process of creating a repo obj, adding the repo obj to the export, and exporting the module.

On line 11 you will see that we are now passing two variables (functions) through the repo.get function. These will be used in the index.js file on fail/success.

Update the index.js app.get() function as follows:
```js
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
    //get the product data from the repo module
    repo.get((data) => {
        res.json({
            //200: The request succeeded
            "status": 200,
            //This can be anything, but short and informative is best
            "statusText": "OK",
            //This is informative of what happened
            "message": "All Product Retrieved",
            //data is the data sent to the client/browser
            "data": data
        })
    }, (err) => {
        //Errors get passed on to our Next Express Middleware
        next(err)
    })
})
```

If you hover over the “repo.get” in Visual Studio Code you will see that it is expecting two functions, a resolve and a reject. We pass it those two functions, with a success passing the json data to the browser, and a reject sending the error to express to handle.

Save the index.js file and refresh the page one more time. You should now see all the products in the products.json file along with our statuses.

To upload this lab for submission, move your node_module folder outside the lab1 folder, compress lab1 (zip or 7zip) then move the node_modules folder back into lab 1. Then submit your compressed lab1.

## Addendum

```repo.get()``` declaration returns a Promise, which is a asynchronic operation. Since I'd like you to use a syntax that matches a synchronic operation, I encourage you to use async/await syntax (Please read about callbacks, Promises, 'callback hell', async vs sync operations). The repo.get declaration refactored would be as follows:
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const fsPromises = fs.promises;

async function loadMonoCounter() {
    const data = await fsPromises.readFile('monolitic.txt');
    return Buffer.from(data);
}

```
