  *_rna.fna.gz file
       FASTA format of accessioned RNA products annotated on the genome 
       assembly; Provided for RefSeq assemblies as relevant (Note, RNA and mRNA 
       products are not instantiated as a separate accessioned record in GenBank
       but are provided for some RefSeq genomes, most notably the eukaryotes.)
       The FASTA title is provided as sequence accession.version plus 
       description.

  *_rna_from_genomic.fna.gz
       FASTA format of the nucleotide sequences corresponding to all RNA 
       features annotated on the assembly, based on the genome sequence. See 
       the "Description of files" section below for details of the file format.

  *_translated_cds.faa.gz
       FASTA sequences of individual CDS features annotated on the genomic 
       records, conceptually translated into protein sequence. The sequence 
       corresponds to the translation of the nucleotide sequence provided in the
       *_cds_from_genomic.fna.gz file. 

   annotation_hashes.txt
       Tab-delimited text file reporting hash values for different aspects
       of the annotation data. See the "Description of files" section below 
       for details of the file format.
   md5checksums.txt file
       file checksums are provided for all data files in the directory
